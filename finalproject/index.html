                        <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">The inauguration of Brasília, on April 21, 1960, is considered a milestone in Brazilian history, as important as Independence (1822) or the Proclamation of the Republic (1889). The creation of the capital promoted the development of the interior of the country and concentrated the political power away from the main urban centers.</p>
                        <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">Brasília was built in the middle of the cerrado, in less than four years, from a modernist conception of urbanism and architecture. The city was the culmination of the developmental project of President Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira (1956-1961), known for the motto "Fifty years in five"</p>

                            <p><strong>"A city planned for orderly and efficient work, but at the same time a lively and pleasant city, proper to reverie and intellectual speculation, capable of becoming, over time, in addition to the center of government and administration, in a cultural focus of the most lucid and sensitive in the country."</strong></p>
                            <p>the starting point for Juscelino Kubitschek to build a new capital for Brazil was during his election campaign. In 1955, at a rally held in Jataí, a city in the state of Goiás, Juscelino was questioned by a voter named Antônio Soares Neto about the construction of a new capital in compliance with the Constitution.

                                Juscelino's response was to state that he would obey the Constitution and that he would put the project into practice. This story is usually told to explain where and when this idea was born in JK. When he assumed the presidency, the project to build Brasília was brought to Congress and approved on September 19, 1956.
                                
                                Law 2,874 inaugurated the process of building the new capital and named it Brasília. For the work to be carried out, the government created Companhia Urbanizadora Nova Capital, a company known as Novacap. Juscelino handed over her command to a person he trusted, the engineer and PSD deputy Israel Pinheiro.
                                
                                This strategy was widely used by JK in the construction of the new capital. He appointed technicians and specialists he trusted in the key posts of the project and gave them carte blanche to build the city. The president also spared no resources, and an exhaustive working day was implemented to meet the capital's delivery deadline.
                                
                                The architect of the building was Oscar Niemeyer, director of the Architecture Department at Novacap. The urban project was designed by Lúcio Costa, an architect who achieved this role after being announced as the winner of the competition organized by Novacap for this purpose (obtaining the urban project), in 1957.</p>
                            <p>The construction of Brasilia was made amid countless challenges. The city with the nearest airport, Anápolis, was more than 100 km away, and the roads that connected to Brasília were dirt. All the material needed to make the work feasible was taken to Brasília with great difficulty. In addition, the fact that everything was taken by plane increased the costs of the work.

                                From a human point of view, the construction of Brasilia also had a high cost. Most of the workers came from the Northeast, but many also came from Goiás and Minas Gerais and became known as candangos. The work was exhausting, the living conditions were poor, and the workers still suffered from the violence of the authorities, and there were even cases of them who were murdered by the police.
                  
                                The city of Brasilia was thought to be the symbol of JK's modernization and development project. The city's innovative architecture conveyed this idea, and the project materialized the president's ideal of interconnecting the two Brazils (coastal and inland) as a key moment for the formation of a new, more modern and developed territory.
                                
                                The construction of Brasília was strongly opposed by the UDN. Udenists took advantage of the situation to attack Juscelino's government, and excessive spending on the construction of the new capital was severely criticized. Despite the criticism, Juscelino's intent was successful, and on April 21, Brasilia, the new Brazilian capital, was officially inaugurated. He still doesn't know how much has been spent to build it.</p>
